          Welcome to my project! This website was created as a personal initiative to track various statistics while learning how to code. 
          I wanted to explore web development and data handling, so I decided to build a platform that lets me experiment with these technologies 
          while also serving as a practical tool for tracking data. 
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed mt-4 text-secondary-gray">
          Through this journey, Iâ€™ve been able to dive into different aspects of web development, improve my coding skills, and deepen my understanding of 
          how to build and manage applications. I hope this project not only helps me grow as a developer but also serves as a resource for anyone interested in 
          the same topics.
